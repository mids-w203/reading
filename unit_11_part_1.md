# What is Explanatory Modeling 

In this part of this week's work, which we anticipate will take about **45** minutes to read, take notes, and attend lecture, you will learn about causal questions and the method of reasoning about, and writing down your causal theory. 

With this knowlege in hand -- or literally on paper in front of you -- you can more easily evaluate whether a statistical model that you have estimated is actually answering the causal question that you have set out to answer.
