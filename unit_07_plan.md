# Plan for the Unit 

This unit introduces the core concepts of classical hypothesis testing. It builds on the knowledge that you built about sampling theory and random varaibles to ask (and answer) questions of the following form. 

- Suppose you have a set of observations from a population distribution, and you want to learn about the expectation of the distribution, $\mu_$. If the sample average is $\bar X$, is $\mu$ equal to 0 (or to some other reference value $\mu_0$)? 

The first test that we introduce -- the t-test -- is just one of a family of tests that all share the same general testing framework. These tests -- the _frequentist tests_ -- all compute a test statistic (which is a random variable) that has a known probability distribution under iid sampling. To conduct a test, this statistic is compared to the known, referece distribution and the data scientist reads off a p-value, which is quite literally the total probability of the reference distribution that is more extreme than the statistic generated by the data. 

The t-test is a workhorse, and also sets a pattern for every other frequentist, statistical test.
