# Foundations of Agnostic Statistics

Please read section 2.2.4 **Best Predictors and Best Linear Predictors** in *Foundations of Agnostic Statistics*. 

- Pages 75—82
- The section titled *Best Predictors and Best Linear Predictors* 

This is a longer section of reading, so here is a reading guide: 

- Pages 75—76 introduce the concept of the *Best Linear Predictor*.
- Pages 77—78 uses calculus to derive a formula for the BLP. Because the function is linear in the terms, the derivative of the function is simplifies really nicely. 
- Page 79 introduces properties of deviations from the *BLP*. Take note about what is similar (and what is different) compared to deviations from the *CEF*. Why does the *BLP* provide fewer guarantees about deviations from the function than the *CEF*? 
- Pages 79—81 go through the *arduous/tedious* process of estimating a BLP by hand, given a specific functional form (i.e. formula) for the variables. Follow through this example; we'll talk about it in a lecture momentarily.
