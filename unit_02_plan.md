# Unit 2: Defining Random Variables 

In this unit you will learn about *random variables*, the mathmatical objects that we use to represent real-world phenomena.

The unit builds on the probability foundations that you learned in the last unit. 

In the first part of this unit's work, you will learn about how discrete and continous random variables work when we consider one random variable at a time. In this, you will learn that there are probability functions that describe how frequently an outcome (a value that the random variable takes on) occur and you will learn about how to manipulate these functions. 

In the second part of this unit's work, you will learn about how discrete and continuous random variables work when we consider two variables at a time.
