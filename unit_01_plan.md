# Unit 1: An Introduction to Probability

In this unit you will learn about the foundations of probability. Probability is a model that we use to reason about the world in the presence of limited information, and is the basis for *every* statistical or machine learning model we ever build. 

We begin the week with an introduction to the axioms of probablity. We'll cover events sample spaces as a way to reason about the world, and to build an intuition for probabilities before we jump into working with more nuanced mathematical objects. 

In the second part of this week we will apply this foundational knowledge to questions of *conditional probability*, *Bayes' Rule*, and *independence*.
