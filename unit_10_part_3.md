# Unit 10: Part 3
## Measurement with Controls 

In this part of the week's work, you will learn about building increasingly informative models by including several variables as "controls". 

You will also learn some general strategies for building out statistical models where you as the data scientist need to make determinations about which features to include (and which to exclude) in your model.
