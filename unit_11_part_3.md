# Unit 11: Part 3 

## Violations of the One-Equation Structural Model 

In this part of the week's work, which we anticipate will take you about **45** minutes to complete, you will assess whether a model you have proposed will credibly identify a causal effect. You will also learn some guidance about what to do if the model does not meet the requirements to measure a causal effect.
