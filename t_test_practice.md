Please head to the School of Information Data Hub to work an exercise to practice writing and reasoning about t-tests. The Data Hub is a compute resource that is provided by Berkeley that you can use for the simple computations, and even report writing for this class. Different from other, ephemeral, cloud computing solutions, this will store your work for 30 days after each login. So, you should be able to use this for the rest of the class, if you like. 

- To start with, please click this [[link](https://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmids-w203%2Fconcept_checks.git&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master)] which will sync a repo with concept check materials over to your ischool datahub. 
- Then, please navigate to `unit_06/unit_06_simulating_a_t_statistic.Rmd`, which you should be able to get to through the navigator on the right hand side. 

In future concept check activities, the files should already be loaded into this directory, `concept_checks`.
