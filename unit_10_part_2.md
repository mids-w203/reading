# Unit 10: Part 2 

## Capturing Nonlinear Relationships 

Although the statistical models that you are building are a linear combination of terms, it does not mean that the outcome values only exist on a plane. 

In this section, you will learn about how to build additional complexity into the models that you build by transforming and shaping input data.
