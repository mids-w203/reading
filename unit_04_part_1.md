# Unit 4: Part 1

## Conditional Expectation

In the first part of this week's work, you will learn about conditional expectation as an *operator* and then the *conditional expectation function*. 

Sometimes these concepts can be a little difficult to keep straightâ€”as we will use them in this class: 

- Functions map inputs onto outputs.  The inputs and outputs could be any sets, but the domain is often a sample space or the real numbers.
- We use the word operator instead of function when the inputs are random variables (which are functions) and the outputs are real numbers.  Each random variable is mapped to a **single** real number.
