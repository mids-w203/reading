# Unit 9: Estimating Uncertainty of OLS Estimates 

In the last unit, you learned about how Ordinary Least Squares Regression -- OLS Regression -- is the plug-in estimator for the BLP. You learned about how to interpret the coefficients of a linear model, and how the OLS algorithm works to estimate the coefficients of the model. 

In this unit, you are going to learn about uncertainty estimates for these estimates. Because estimates of OLS regression coefficients are based on samples of data, different samples of data might generate different coefficients. We have two learning goals for this unit: 

1. To understand that OLS regression coefficients' standard errors are a produce of sampling, and to appreciate the similarity of this concept to measures of uncertainty from hypothesis in earlier units. 

2. To conduct appropriate tests within the Frequentist testing framework. These tests include tests for a null hypothsis for individual coefficients, and tests for a null hypothesis about an ensemble of coefficients.
