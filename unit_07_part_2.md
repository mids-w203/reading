# Unit Plan: Part 2

## Nonparametric Tests for Two Groups

In this part of the week's work, you will extend the hypothesis testing framework that you have been developing to apply the testing framework to non-metric data.

One of the key takeaways from this is that *there is little need to memorize a litany of tests*. All hypothesis tests follow a similar structure, where a sample test-statistic is compared to a reference distribution. If you can name the type of comparison that you would like to make, you can then use a reference to find the appropriate test.
