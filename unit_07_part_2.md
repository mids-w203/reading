# Unit 7: Part 2

## Nonparametric Tests for Two Groups

In this part of the week's work, which we anticipate should take you **60** minutes to read, take notes, and attend lecture, you will extend the hypothesis testing framework that you have been developing to apply the testing framework to non-metric data.

One of the key takeaways from this is that *there is little need to memorize a litany of tests*. All hypothesis tests follow a similar structure, where a sample test-statistic is compared to a reference distribution. If you can name the type of comparison that you would like to make, you can then use a reference to find the appropriate test.
