# Unit 10: Part 1 

## Types of Model Building 

In this part of the week's work, which we anticipate will take you about **25** minutes to complete, you will learn about the different goals that you might have when building a statistical model, and will lay a framework for understanding why we make different modeling choices when we have one-or-another goal.
