# Unit 5: Part 1 

## Random Sampling

In this first part of the week's work, which we anticipate might take you **two hours** we are going to switch gears to start building out statistical, rather than pure mathematical reasoning. 

At this point, we begin to ask (and hopefully answer!) questions like: 

- If we know that the math works when it is *pure*, then what guarantees can we get when we do the *dirty work* of dealing with data? 
- What sorts of processes lead data to be distributed in particular ways? 
- And, why is it distributed in these ways? 

To be specific, you will learn: 

- About statistics (which are just functions applied to data) and properties that you might want your statistics to possess in order to be useful. 
- The *Weak Law of Large Numbers*, which states that under general conditions the *sample mean* *converges in probability* to the expected value of a random variable. 

This begins what some people might recognize as core statistics work.
