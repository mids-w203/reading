# Unit 12: Part 1 
## Assumptions of the Classical Linear Model 

In this section, you will learn about the assumptions about data that must be met in order for the *Classical Linear Model* to produce reliable estimates. 

We should be clear from the outset: while these are referred to as *assumptions* it is not the case that you can simply assume them to be true about the data that you are using. 

While we will use the term *assumptions* throughout the unit, you might do well to think of them as *requirements* of the data, or *conditions that must be true* about the data. 

OLS regression as an algorithm is a jackhammer: the algorithm, even when run in small samples,  will almost always produce some result. The *Classical Linear Model* is a method of reasoning about whether these results are useful
