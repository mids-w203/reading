# Unit 5: Part 2 

## Estimation Theory and the CLT 

In this part of work, you are going to learn about properties of statistics. When statistics have desirable properties, we might name them with some special designation -- *estimator* because they do a good job of estimating a population quantity that we are interested in. 

Then, you will build toward a working understanding of the *Central Limit Theorem*.
