# Unit 10: Part 4

## Modeling Conditional Effects 

In this part of the week's work, you will learn about how to think about relationships that might change based on other contextual features. For example, how much data science literature does someone read: 

1. If they are a data scientist or not a data scientist? 
2. Is this difference between groups *conditionally* different if it is the weekend or a week day?
