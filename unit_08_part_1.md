# Unit 8: Part 1 
## Understanding Linear Models 

In this part of the unit, you will learn about linear models as a method of making predictions and estimating relationships. 

Linear models are versatile, reasonably flexible, and are sometimes interpretable. Linear models are a fantastic entry-point into data science model building because it is possible to see each part of the model, reason about what is happening within the model, and potentially make changes to either the data or the model in order to let the model and data work *better* together. 

This section begins by making the claim that all models are simple abstractions of the complex world we live in. We then introduce the main pieces of a linear model, and describe how a model makes a prediction, and why the MSE between predictions and data is a useful, general-purpose metric for how well a model is performing.
